# Container Apps runs linux/amd64 only, and the dev host here is arm64 (Docker
# Desktop on Apple Silicon). A native build produces an image that crash-loops
# with an exec format error and no other clue, so every build for deployment
# must pass --platform linux/amd64. The Makefile's `build` target does it rather
# than leaving it to memory.

# Builder and runtime both derive from `base`, and that is load-bearing rather
# than tidy. The runtime stage copies the whole virtualenv, and a venv is bound
# to the exact minor version that created it — its packages live in
# lib/python3.X/site-packages and no other interpreter will look there. In
# market-agent, while the stages named their Python separately, a Renovate
# "non-major" bump moved the runtime from 3.12 to 3.14 and left the builder on
# 3.12; the resulting image had no site-packages on sys.path at all and died
# with a bare "No module named". One FROM line means they cannot drift again.
